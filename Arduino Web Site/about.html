            <p>Arduino’s mission is to enable anyone to enhance their lives through accessible electronics and digital technologies. There was once a barrier between the electronics, design, and programming world and the rest of the world. Arduino has broken down that barrier.

                Over the years, our products have been the brains behind thousands of projects, from everyday objects to complex scientific instruments. A worldwide community, comprising students, hobbyists, artists, programmers, and professionals, has gathered around this open-source platform, their contributions adding up to an incredible amount of accessible knowledge.
                
                Our vision is to make Arduino available to everyone, whether you are a student, maker or professional, which is why we now have three segments to our business. These segments work together as an ecosystem with a shared mindset: we started with Maker, and that has evolved into Education and PRO solutions.

            <h1 style="text-align: center;">Maker</h1>
    
            <p>Find creative solutions to everyday challenges.

                For makers around the world, our goal is to democratize the most advanced technologies and create a new set of opportunities for creative people, whether that’s through connected products, advanced sensors, Cloud & Apps, machine learning, AI, etc.
                
                Arduino empowers creative minds to master technology and intuitively solve everyday problems. Our platform simplifies the use of otherwise complex tools. For example, programming a securely connected IoT device is just a few clicks away with the use of the Arduino Cloud.

            <h1 style="text-align: center;">Edu</h1>
    
            <p>Empower the next generations of students to be the disruptors of the future

                For middle school, high school, and university educators who want to deliver relevant, fun, and creative STEAM lessons that enable all students to thrive, Arduino Education’s open-source approach and cross-curriculum content are essential tools that develop and empower students as they progress through their STEAM education.
                
                Our classroom programs include kits, bundles, and boards with project-based learning paths for individual and collaborative educational approaches. Teaching remotely? We have kits designed for remote, individual learning, making hands-on STEAM education accessible even when the classroom isn’t.

            <h1 style="text-align: center;">Pro</h1>
    
            <p>Enable businesses of any size to exploit the potential of AI and IoT

                The PRO line is designed to enable businesses to quickly and securely connect remote sensors to business logic within one simple IoT application development platform, transferring the productivity and creativity that makers enjoy with Arduino into the business world.
                
                We aim to help companies transform their business models with IoT, providing robust, hackable, and understandable IoT hardware and SaaS platforms.
                
                Arduino can support the full development, production, and operation lifecycle, from hardware and firmware to low code, Cloud, and mobile apps.
